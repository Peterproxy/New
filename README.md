This is a game I coded after following a video tutorial on Youtube.

KINDLY NOTE THAT GAME IS NOT COMPLETED YET!!!

Modifications are added as work progresses on the project until it is perfect. 

By the time you check again, more modifications would have been added.


GAME RULES:

- The game has 2 players, playing in rounds
- In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he whishes. Each result get added to his ROUND score
- BUT, if the player rolls a 1, all his ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his GLOBAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The first player to reach 100 points on GLOBAL score wins the game
